# GenArt
A little software to make generative art over photos. Used to make a portrait for my girlfriend!

## Install
First of all you need to install Cairo's dependencies in Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```

Then install npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Tested with NodeJS 15 on Ubuntu 20.04 and 20.10
